1. Return importance dataframe in PFI
2. Adapt PFI for cross validation if passed (cv object as input) --> 1 df for fold
3. Adapt RFE to fit-transform --> Javi
3. Create scorer for metrics based on sklearn make-scorer  -> Javi
4. Create structure of HyperFeatureSelection class
5. Allow a preprocessig pipeline for data in PFI and RFE
6. Create a log dataframe for PFI-RFE excution
